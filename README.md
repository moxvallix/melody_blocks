Melody Blocks is a data pack for Minecraft 1.15, that allows for compact noteblock creation, in the form of Melody Blocks.

Melody Blocks are made by standing atop a noteblock, and clicking "Get Melody Block" in the tool book. To get said book, hold a book in your off-hand and a noteblock in your mainhand.
Each melody block can hold 16 notes, and can be powered with a redstone signal to play. To set the notes, stand on top off a noteblock. Tune it to a note, then click "Block" in the row that you want that note to be played. The rows are played in numerical order, and the timing between each note can be set by standing above a repeater, set to the time wanted, and clicking "Set Timing". After setting each of the rows to a note or a pause, stand close to the Melody Block you want to have that melody, and click paste. If you have a few Melody Blocks near each other, use "Check Melody Block Target" to see which one is targeted.

Current features:
- 16 Notes
- Can be powered to play
- Can play back the melody you have made, by pressing "Test Melody"
- Redstone functionality (Buttons, dust, comparators and repeaters)
- Instruments based on block below (Like a noteblock)

Future features:
- Per-row timing

Changes in this version:
Added support for instruments.

Feel free to give any suggestions for future features, as I'm hoping to make this a very versatile tool.
